# Knigt_of_the_Small_Table

Hello, dear guest.
This repository serves as our connection, here the data about my game is updated - 2D platformer "Knigt of the Small Table".

The idea is elementary simple:
- Fights with a sword and magic;
- A bit of black humor;
- Annoying bosses;
- and pleasure!

A little about myself:

I am GoStok, my name is Anton, I come from scary Russia :-).
Musician (genres: synthwave, retrowave, councilwave and shoegaze) and a fan of gaming (especially old games, for example Heroes of Might and Magic).

This is my first project, my first game.
I hope it will be at least a little decent, at least for a beginner.

Here I aim more at experience and pleasure.

I hope to see you soon in KotST!
